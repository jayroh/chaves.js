        Hi. My name's Joel. I am a developer living in Boston, I work at
        <a href='http://thoughtbot.com'>Thoughtbot</a> and I like keyboard
        shortcuts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not the only person who's ever thought "Wow, &lt;INSERT WEBSITE/APP
        HERE&gt; sure would be <em><strong>even more</strong></em> awesome/fantastic/
        hella rad/wicked pissah if it had some keyboard shortcuts." - am I
        right? If you're constantly using sites like Gmail, Google reader,
        <a href='http://github.com/jayroh'>Github</a>, etc then you are pretty
        used to a full assortment of fast and efficient actions but a
        key-press or two away.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't often use keyboard shortcuts available to you ... then I
        got nothing for you except a questioning glare tinged with disappointent.
        <small><a href='http://dl.dropbox.com/u/73698777/gifs/wtf%20are%20you%20doing%20cat.gif'
        target='_blank'>Seriously ... ?</a></small>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are handful of decent JS libraries out there to help you get your
        own app sufficially shortcut'ed, but I found that there wasn't much in
        the way of a quick and flexible set of defaults with the ability to
        configure as I see fit. <q>Convention over configuration</q>. That's a 
        thing, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        So here's my shot at this. A small jQuery plugin called "Chaves.js" that leans
        on both jQuery and Thomas Fuch's
        <a href='https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster'>Keymaster.js</a>. What
        does "chaves" mean? It's portuguese for "keys". I know - clever!
      </p>
      <p>
        The element you call "chaves()" against will allow you to navigate its 
        direct children, setting an 'active' class on the current child, with 
        the <em>"j"</em> and <em>"k"</em> keys -- optionally with the up and 
        down keys. <em>"Enter"</em> will click on the first anchor tag. The 
        <em>"/"</em> key will focus on a search field, if it has a commonly 
        named id, name or placeholder value. And, finally, <em>"shift + /"</em> 
        -- or more commonly <em>"?"</em> -- will display a help dialog.
      </p>
      <p>
        The help dialog is dynamically built from the registered key-bindings.
        If you would care to, instead, build that dialog with your own markup 
        the plugin will hook into that instead. Just create an element with a 
        class <code>'jquery-chaves-help'</code> -- or, if you pass a different
        classname in the options it will use that classname.
      </p>
